This project analyzes consumer safety patterns in beauty products using the Healthy Beauty dataset. The goal of this analysis is to examine trends in reported chemicals across brands and product categories, and to assess whether certain brands tend to specialize in specific types of products that are more frequently associated with chemical reports.

The analysis was performed in R using the following approaches:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, and boxplots
- Statistical testing, including chi-square tests for independence to examine the relationship between brand and product category

Key Findings
- Certain brands tend to focus on specific product categories.
- Makeup products appear frequently among reported chemical disclosures.
- Brands that primarily produce makeup products are more likely to appear among those with higher numbers of reported chemicals, reflecting category-specific reporting patterns rather than overall brand risk.
- These findings suggest that observed differences across brands are largely driven by the types of products they produce.
